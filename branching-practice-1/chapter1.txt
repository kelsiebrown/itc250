Once upon a time....
There was a tiny bat who lived in his tiny cave, outside of a tiny town.
He was different from other bats; he did not like the taste of blood.
He always thought it was too big, too red and too sour.
This tiny bat wanted something tiny, not red, and sweet.
However, to find this sweet treat he knew he would have to leave his tiny cave.  
He gathered his supplies - a bag full of dried bugs and his lucky branch - and began his journey out.

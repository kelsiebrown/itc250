Once upon a time....
There was a tiny bat who lived in his tiny cave, outside of a tiny town.
He was different from other bats; he did not like the taste of blood.
He always thought it was too big, too red and too sour.
This tiny bat wanted something tiny, not red, and sweet.
However, to find this sweet treat he knew he would have to leave his tiny cave.  
He gathered his supplies - a bag full of dried bugs and his lucky branch - and began his journey out.
He flapped, fluttered and flew out to the great big world.
Out there were bugs, rats, and all sorts of big squirmy things.
But nothing sweet or tiny.
Nothing that he was looking for!
"Whatever will I do!" sqeaked the tiny bat
As he was ready to give up all hope, he noticed something. 
Far, far away, out of the corner of his eye, a flash of color caught his attention.
A flash so quick that he just barely saw it, and with it a curious smell.
It wasn't a grubby, bloody or disgusting smell, but something different entirely.
He flapped his tiny wings and soon he saw a massive tree, bigger than anything.
And dropping from its branches down were these sweet smelling... well he didn't know. 
They were massive! Bigger than him! Orange and yellow and every shade of the sunset.
"I wonder if they have any blood" he thought, taking a nibble.
And just like that he found they had the sweetest blood ever!
"Trees have blood! How wonderful! I will call it treeblood".
But something was waiting for him in that tree...
It was a snake! A slippery, silent snake. 
He flapped and flipped and dazzled the fearsome beast.
The snake chased him, snapping with bloody teeth.
The snake twisted iteslf in to a knot trying to eat the little beastie.
And fell, hissing from the tree.
The tiny bat flew back to his tiny cavewith his sack of treeblood.
And they all lived happily ever after.
